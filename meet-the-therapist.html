            <h3>Renée Cordobes, LMFT, PPS-SC</h3>
            
            <p>I am a graduate of John F Kennedy University, obtaining a Master's Degree in Counseling Psychology, with an emphasis in Marriage and Family Therapy. I am currently licensed as a LMFT in California and Oregon. I also hold a license to practice Telehealth in Florida.</p> 
                
            <p>I hold a credential in School Counseling, with emphasis in Behavior Intervention and Management. I am certified in Expressive Arts, Group Process, and Grief and Loss Therapy. I have also received additional specialized training in Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-TF), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) and Gestalt Therapy. I am well-versed in Parent Coaching and Co-Parenting strategies, utilizing Positive Discipline and Communication.</p>

            <p>The foundation of my therapeutic philosophy is enhancing positive connections within primary relationships, through compassion and acceptance. My intention is to offer my office as a safe and calming environment free from judgement. A place for you to discover your true nature and to experience your place in the world.</p>

            <p>To that end, I will listen and support you in reaching your stated goals, creatively and compassionately. I hope to foster and help strengthen the desire for you to define and embrace your personal power. I will respect your beliefs and honor your cultural identity. And most of all, I will celebrate all that makes you UNIQUE!</p>
